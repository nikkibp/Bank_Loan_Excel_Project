# Bank Loan Overview

This repository contains my work in Microsoft Excel.

This project consists of an excel dashboard on the Bank Loan data. Concepts like Excel functions, Pivot Tables, Excel charts, etc were used in this. Along with the dashboard, it presents some business insights in a report.





## Business Problem Reqirements

DASHBOARD 1:
"In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
Total Loan Applications
Total Funded Amount
Total Amount Received
Average Interest Rate
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)


Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s:

In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria

Good Loan KPIs:
Good Loan Application Percentage
Good Loan Applications
Good Loan Funded Amount
Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loan KPIs:
Bad Loan Application Percentage
Bad Loan Applications
Bad Loan Funded Amount
Bad Loan Total Received Amount

Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

DASHBOARD 2: 
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. 
Below are the specific chart requirements:

1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):
Chart Type: Line Chart

2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):
Chart Type: Filled Map

3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):
Chart Type: Donut Chart
4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):
Chart Type: Bar Chart
5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):
Chart Type: Bar Chart


6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):
Chart Type: Tree Map

These diverse chart types will enhance our ability to visualize and communicate loan-related insights effectively, supporting data-driven decisions and strategic planning within our lending operations."
